# SNHU_CS210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was created to sort and display grocery shopper data. The client requested the display to show the quantity of the items to help influence their decision in placement of those items in the store.
What did you do particularly well?
  I felt in this project I did well in the step by step creation of it. Each step along the way I continued to run the program and test it. Giving me the opportunity to adjust smaller problems before they influenced a great portion of the program.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I felt I had to continually type our each section of the dictionary created(key:item / definition: quantity). If I could create a way to store the data in a way that was able to be recalled with less code it would have made the code shorter and easier to read.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found it most difficult to address the sections of code that asked for a user input. The code is expecting only a certain type on input, and the code has to be able to work and produce the same results even if the user inputs a different value.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This project helped me understand the skill of running the program very frequently. As soon as I add a new line or two...run the code. Don't wait until the larger sections are complete. A flow chart helped me understand the smaller sections.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The program is maintainable because of the comments, and calling function or lists to minimize the repeated lines. I feel anyone can read the code and understand what it suppose to do regardless if they don't understand Python or C++.
